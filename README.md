# conda-sigstore

`conda-sigstore` creates and verifies Sigstore attestations for conda packages.
It can also audit installed environments and, when explicitly enabled, reject a
package before extraction when acceptable evidence is unavailable or invalid.

The project is alpha software. Version 0.1.0 is distributed through PyPI. The
opt-in install integration requires the unreleased package-verifier API in
[conda/conda#16518](https://github.com/conda/conda/pull/16518), and draft
transport and source-evidence formats may still change incompatibly.

## What it does

- Verify a package against a local or remote Sigstore bundle.
- Create a signed [CEP 27](https://github.com/conda/ceps/blob/main/cep-0027.md)
  publication statement.
- Audit installed packages for publication, provenance, and recipe source
  evidence.
- Require valid CEP 27 evidence before conda extracts a package.
- Read the draft repodata-advertised immutable `.sigs.<sha256>` transport and,
  separately, Prefix.dev's current `.v0.sigs` convention.

The draft transport follows
[conda/ceps#142](https://github.com/conda/ceps/pull/142) at commit
`bcfcf42990fb4e5446f33424353ba0b7c0e869f0`. Current conda `PackageRecord`
objects do not preserve its `attestations_sha256` field, so real solver,
install, and installed-environment audit flows require a corresponding conda
change before they can select the draft transport.

## Install

Install 0.1.0 from PyPI into the environment that owns the `conda` executable.
The [installation guide](https://jezdez.github.io/conda-sigstore/how-to/install/)
also documents the source preview and the separate requirements for install
enforcement.

## Commands

```console
conda sigstore attest PACKAGE --target-channel URL [--output PATH]
conda sigstore verify ARTIFACT --bundle PATH_OR_URL [--channel URL] \
  [--cert-identity IDENTITY --cert-oidc-issuer URL] [--json]
conda sigstore audit [-n ENV | -p PREFIX] [--sources] [--prefix-sidecars] [--json]
```

## Security boundary

A successful result proves that Sigstore verified the bundle and that its CEP
27 statement binds the package filename and SHA-256. It reports the
authenticated signer and can compare an included target-channel claim.

It does not prove that the signer was authorized to publish to that channel,
that the package was built safely, or that its contents are benign.
