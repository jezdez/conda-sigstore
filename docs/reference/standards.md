# Standards and formats

`conda-sigstore` implements one accepted conda statement format alongside
draft and service-specific transport and source-evidence formats.

## CEP 27 publication statement

CEP 27 defines a publication attestation as an
[in-toto Statement v1](https://github.com/in-toto/attestation/blob/main/spec/v1/statement.md)
with this predicate type:

```text
https://schemas.conda.org/attestations-publish-1.schema.json
```

A statement created by `conda sigstore attest` has this shape:

```json
{
  "_type": "https://in-toto.io/Statement/v1",
  "subject": [
    {
      "name": "example-1.0-0.conda",
      "digest": {
        "sha256": "<artifact digest>"
      }
    }
  ],
  "predicateType": "https://schemas.conda.org/attestations-publish-1.schema.json",
  "predicate": {
    "targetChannel": "https://conda.example.org/team"
  }
}
```

The plugin requires exactly one subject. The subject name must be a bare
`.conda` or `.tar.bz2` package filename containing name, version, and build
components. Its digest mapping must contain only a SHA-256 of the exact package
bytes.

CEP 27 permits an absent target channel. The plugin represents that as an
omitted or null `predicate`. When `predicate` is an object, it must contain a
valid credential-free HTTP or HTTPS `targetChannel` without a query, fragment,
or trailing slash. `conda sigstore attest` always requires and records the
target channel. Verification compares an included claim only when the caller
supplies an expected channel.

CEP 27 is a publication claim. It is not SLSA build provenance and does not
prove source, recipe, builder, or build-process properties.

## Sigstore Bundle v0.3

The CEP 27 statement is DSSE signed and stored in one Sigstore Bundle v0.3
object. The bundle contains the signing certificate and transparency-log
material. It may also contain supported signed timestamp material.

`conda sigstore attest` writes one bundle object as
`<artifact>.sigstore.json`. A channel sidecar is a nonempty JSON array of one
or more complete bundle objects. Multiple entries are independent attestations
or signatures. They are not described as countersignatures by this plugin.

One cryptographically valid, artifact-bound CEP 27 entry is sufficient for a
verified package result. Invalid, unsupported, or nonmatching siblings remain
visible as failures but do not overturn a valid entry.

## Tool responsibilities

| Tool | Behavior | Conda-specific boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `sigstore sign` | Creates a message signature over bytes | Does not create a CEP 27 statement |
| `sigstore verify identity` | Verifies Sigstore material against an identity and issuer | Does not enforce the plugin's complete CEP 27 filename, predicate, and target-channel checks |
| `conda sigstore attest` | Creates and signs one strict CEP 27 statement | Writes evidence but does not upload it |
| `conda sigstore verify` | Verifies Sigstore material, CEP 27 artifact binding, optional target channel, and an optional exact signer pair | Does not discover channel publisher delegation |
| opt-in package verifier | Requires valid CEP 27 evidence before extraction | Enforces evidence validity, not signer authorization |
| Rattler-Build `--generate-attestation` | Creates CEP 27 bundles during Prefix.dev publication | Prefix.dev producer path |
| `actions/attest` | Creates a Sigstore-backed in-toto attestation with a caller-supplied predicate | Workflow must create the exact CEP 27 subject and predicate expected here |

See [Verify with sigstore-python](../how-to/verify-with-sigstore.md) and
[Publish attestations to Prefix.dev](../how-to/publish-prefix.md) for operator
workflows.

## Draft repodata sidecar transport

[conda/ceps#142](https://github.com/conda/ceps/pull/142) is an open proposal
for serving attestation sidecars. The plugin calls it the `repodata` transport.

For `example-1.0-0.conda`, the proposed sidecar is
`example-1.0-0.conda.sigs`. The package's repodata record advertises the exact
sidecar SHA-256 and size:

```json
{
  "attestations": {
    "sha256": "<SHA-256 of exact sidecar bytes>",
    "size": 12345
  }
}
```

The plugin applies these rules:

- `attestations` contains exactly `sha256` and `size`
- `sha256` is 64 lowercase hexadecimal characters
- `size` is a positive integer within the configured sidecar limit
- the sidecar is a nonempty JSON array of bundle objects
- absence of the descriptor means that no `.sigs` sidecar is advertised
- the client never probes for an undeclared `.sigs` file
- exact response size and SHA-256 are checked before JSON parsing
- the HTTP `Content-Type` is advisory and does not decide bundle validity

A present descriptor is authoritative. Descriptor, retrieval, size, digest,
container, or verification failure does not fall back to another transport.

The proposal remains open, so this transport may require an incompatible
change before a stable release.

## Prefix.dev compatibility transport

The current Prefix.dev producer path used by Pixi, Rattler-Build, and
`rattler_upload` publishes `<artifact>.v0.sigs` as a JSON array of Bundle v0.3
objects. Existing Prefix.dev channels do not advertise the sidecar hash and
size in repodata.

Explicit `.v0.sigs` input keeps the weaker discovery and integrity model
visible in verification and audit commands. The opt-in install verifier also
uses this deterministic adjacent name when the selected repodata record has no
descriptor. It first binds the signed CEP 27 statement to the package SHA-256
supplied by conda.

Public client behavior does not establish whether the proprietary Prefix.dev
server compares a bundle signer with the upload identity. The plugin reports
the authenticated signer without claiming that Prefix.dev authorized it.

## Draft source-attestation evidence

[conda/ceps#168](https://github.com/conda/ceps/pull/168) is an open proposal
for declaring and preserving source attestations in recipes and built
packages. It is separate from accepted CEP 27 publication statements.

`conda sigstore audit --sources` implements an audit-only subset over retained
package archives. The exact parser and bundle checks are documented in
[Source-attestation audit format](source-attestations.md). Source evidence
cannot authorize a CEP 27 publication signer.

Generic SLSA Provenance v1 does not designate one resolved dependency as the
source. The plugin reports all materials without guessing which one represents
the source or assigning a SLSA level.

Converted PEP 740 or PyPI bundles without canonical Rekor entries are rejected.
The draft embedded index does not authenticate bundle-conversion provenance,
so the plugin does not disable Sigstore transparency-log verification for
those bundles.
