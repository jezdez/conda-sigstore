## Current plugin contract

### Conda package-verifier hook

The plugin registers `conda_package_verifiers` directly against the draft API
in [conda/conda#16518](https://github.com/conda/conda/pull/16518). The locked
developer environments use `jezdez/conda` branch
`feature/package-verifiers`. Released conda versions do not provide this hook.

The hook is disabled unless `plugins.conda_sigstore_enforce` is true. When
enabled, conda invokes the named verifier after validating the package size and
strongest available package digest and before extraction. Every registered
verifier must return successfully for extraction to proceed.

The callback receives:

- the selected `PackageRecord` or an explicit URL `MatchSpec`
- the read-only archive path
- the SHA-256 computed by conda

The callback raises `CondaVerificationError` to reject the archive. Callbacks
may run concurrently for different archives, may run more than once, and must
not mutate the archive.

The plugin requires the archive filename to match the selected record or URL.
For the PR 142 transport, it also requires the selected record to preserve
`attestations_sha256`. Current conda `PackageRecord` objects and solver
conversion paths do not preserve that field, so real solver, install, and
installed-audit flows need a conda change before they can select the PR 142
transport. The selected package URL and conda-supplied artifact SHA-256 are
sufficient only for the separate Prefix.dev adjacent compatibility path.

When only an extracted cache entry remains, conda must redownload the archive
or fail offline. A package-record digest does not authenticate extracted files.

### Install evidence selection

When enforcement is enabled:

1. a present, valid repodata `attestations_sha256` field selects
   `<artifact>.sigs.<attestations_sha256>`
2. an invalid `attestations_sha256` value is rejected before URL construction
3. without `attestations_sha256`, plugin enforcement policy requires adjacent
   `<artifact>.v0.sigs`
4. any selected retrieval, streaming-limit, digest, container, cryptographic,
   statement, or binding failure rejects the package
5. a present field never falls back to `.v0.sigs`

One cryptographically valid CEP 27 statement must bind the exact filename and
SHA-256. This is evidence-validity enforcement. It does not establish that the
channel authorized the authenticated signer.

### Prefix.dev compatibility

Prefix.dev `.v0.sigs` is explicit in verification and audit commands. The
install verifier also uses that deterministic adjacent name when no repodata
`attestations_sha256` field exists. This is service-specific plugin policy
outside PR 142. Repodata discovery itself never probes for an undeclared
sidecar and never fetches the mutable `.sigs` URL.

## Open integration proposals

### Repodata field preservation

The proposal in [conda/ceps#142](https://github.com/conda/ceps/pull/142)
at commit `bcfcf42990fb4e5446f33424353ba0b7c0e869f0` defines the optional scalar
`attestations_sha256` field on package records. It must contain exactly 64
lowercase hexadecimal characters. To remain usable after a solve, the field
must survive:

- monolithic and sharded repodata
- classic and libmamba solver conversion
- package-cache records
- prefix records and `repodata_record.json`
- repodata patching, JLAP, compression, mirroring, and indexing

The libmamba bridge must associate it with the exact artifact URL and filename
because `.conda` and `.tar.bz2` artifacts can otherwise share package identity
fields.

Current conda does not preserve `attestations_sha256` on `PackageRecord` or
through the solver conversions. Until conda adds that support, real solve,
install, package-cache, prefix-record, and installed-audit paths cannot consume
the PR 142 field. The separate Prefix.dev adjacent path does not require this
field.

### Channel sidecar publication

`conda sigstore attest` emits one raw Bundle v0.3 object. It does not assemble
a sidecar array, modify repodata, or upload channel files.

An implementation of the draft repodata transport would need to:

- associate one or more complete bundles with an immutable package artifact
- serialize the final nonempty bundle array once
- calculate the SHA-256 from the exact serialized bytes
- publish those bytes first at immutable `<artifact>.sigs.<sha256>`
- update mutable `<artifact>.sigs` to the same exact bytes for generic tooling
- place `attestations_sha256` in every relevant repodata representation only
  after the immutable URL is available
- retain old immutable URLs while the corresponding package remains available

The exact field, endpoint, and container rules are in
[Standards and formats](standards.md).

### Source-evidence handoff

The proposal in [conda/ceps#168](https://github.com/conda/ceps/pull/168) is a
separate recipe and package-audit integration. `conda-sigstore` reads only its
embedded audit subset. See
[Source-attestation audit format](source-attestations.md).

Source and SLSA evidence do not authorize a CEP 27 publication signer and do
not assign a SLSA level.

Publisher delegation is a separate design problem. See
{ref}`publisher-delegation`.
